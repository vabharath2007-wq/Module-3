# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. assign s=0
3. loop the items in list
4. write condition for sum
5. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

items=[1,6,4,7,8,9,5,3]

sum_numbers=0

for x in items:

    sum_numbers+=x

print(sum_numbers)

## Output

## Result
Thus, the program is simulated sucessfully
